<p>We render the pages JUST for include piece of html commun in all pages like the navbar or footer. With rendering we avoided any inconsistency with the navbar in all pages.
We are sure the dynamic data is NEVER rendered by the server beacause we never access the model classes anywhere but in the API logic (in the API folder)</p>
<h3 id="api">API</h3>
<h4 id="rest-compliance">REST compliance</h4>
<p><em>Describe here to what extent did you follow REST principles and what are
the reasons for which you might have decided to diverge. Note, you must
not describe the whole API here, just the design decisions.</em>
We have create complete REST API, we didn't implemented all CRUD operations for each model if not necessary for the web application with exeption for the POST API used by our team to populate the database</p>
<h4 id="openapi-resource-models">OpenAPI Resource models</h4>
<p><em>Describe here synthetically, which models you have introduced for
resources.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Event</li>
<li>Seminar</li>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Performer</li>
<li>Company</li>
<li>EventType</li>
<li>Reservation</li>
<li>User</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="data-model">Data model</h3>
<p><img src="http://localhost:3000/images/doc/ER-diagram.png" alt="ER diagram">
All OpenAPI models have also an Entity in the ER diagram except for Reservation, which is represented in the diagram as a reletionship from User to Event</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<h3 id="tools-used">Tools used</h3>
<p>Describe here which tools, languages and frameworks did you use for the
backend of the application.</p>
<ul>
<li>express: to simplyfy the creation of a web server and devide routing</li>
<li>passposrt (with passwport-jwt): to simplify the login and authentication verification process through a JWT</li>
<li>ejs: just to use the <code>include</code> function to avoid for example the need of change every paga for a mistake in the navigation bar (we never render data from the model)</li>
<li>mysql2: to interact with the MySql server</li>
<li>bcrypt: to hash the password before save them into the DB</li>
<li>nodemon: to avoid restarting the server after any change</li>
<li>nodemailer: to send the email for the email verification (removed the need of verify the email after usability evaluation)</li>
<li>express-openapi-validator: to validate the input of the API in line with the OpenAPI specification</li>
<li>swagger-ui-express: to provide the a UI to the OpenAPI specification</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>We extensevly tested all the API with the help of swaggerui</li>
<li>We crated API that are easy to understand and documented with OpenAPI specification, they accept and return only JSON object with the data, so that anyone can create either a web application, Android application or any other sort of application using the same API.</li>
<li>We managed the authentication with JSON Web Token, returning the JWT when the POST API for login is called. Then this JWT need to be added in the header of the calls to the API that need authentication</li>
<li>We used MySQL database mainly because we found more documentation about it then other type of relational database</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-information">Other information</h2>
<h3 id="task-assignment">Task assignment</h3>
<p>Describe here how development tasks have been subdivided among members
of the group, e.g.:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Foo worked on front end (80%) and OpenAPI Spec (20% of the time)</li>
<li>Bar worked on ....</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="analysis-of-existing-api">Analysis of existing API</h3>
<p>For almost all API we watch <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide/">this course</a>
because it is one of the most complete course on NodeJs and has two section dedicated to REST APIs</p>
<h3 id="learning-outcome">Learning outcome</h3>
<p>What was the most important thing all the members have learned while
developing this part of the project, what questions remained unanswered,
how you will use what you've learned in your everyday life?
6Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Foo learned to write SQL queries and Javascript but wanted to know
more about caching, he's probably going to create his own startup
with what she has learned</li>
<li>Bar learned how to deploy on a cloud platform, he would have liked
to know more about promises for asynchronous code..</li>
</ul>
